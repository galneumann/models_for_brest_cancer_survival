## Breast Cancer Survival Prediction
Overview: This repository contains a comparison of three machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Decision Trees—for predicting breast cancer survival outcomes. The project leverages clinical data from the SEER dataset, focusing on pre-processing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to identify the most effective prediction approach.

Key Features:
- Implementation of three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, ANN, and Decision Tree.
- Comprehensive preprocessing, including IQR-based outlier removal, normalization, and feature engineering.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize patterns and understand dataset features.
- Evaluation metrics like accuracy, recall, precision, and AUC-ROC for model comparison.
